">Why are some countries blocked from using CSGOEmpire?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Due to the laws and regulations, we've restricted access from some countries. For example, online gambling is not permitted in the USA, which is why we don't allow traffic from USA IP addresses.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="withdrawal-limits" style="

    color: #c9c9c9;
">At most times, we have more than $50 million worth of Bitcoin in our cold storage. However, the balance in our hot wallets rarely exceeds more than $3 million. If you are looking to withdraw amounts bigger than that, you may need to wait a couple of days for us to re-fill our wallets.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="betting-limits" style="

">On roulette, the maximum bet amount is 100,000 coins. However, we can easily increase this upon request.</p><p class="size-large" style="

">In match betting, the limits vary from player to player. In order to stop us from bleeding money to some professional bettors, we need to set strict betting limits on their accounts.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="underaged" style="

">What about underaged gambling?</h2><p class="size-large" style="

">Like any regulated casino, we don't allow minors to gamble. We do KYC (Know-Your-Customer) checks, which means that the players have to confirm their identity, location, and age.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="how-kyc-works" style="

    color: #c9c9c9;
">When you first sign up on CSGOEmpire, we ask you to write your personal information.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Then, as required by the laws, rules, and moral standards, there are scenarios where we request players to prove their personal information. Below are some example scenarios where we perform a KYC check:</p><p class="size-large"></p><ul><li style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When you deposit substantial amounts of money</li><li style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When you attempt to withdraw over 2000 coins (cumulative) worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum</li><li style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">For example, in cases of suspicious behavior, if there is a suspicion of the player being underaged.</li></ul><p></p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When a player is required to complete a KYC check, their option to deposit, withdraw, or gamble their coins, will be blocked. The KYC is completed by submitting one document with proof of identity and one with proof of address.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">If the player refuses or fails to complete the check, they will remain blocked from depositing and gambling -- Essentially, they must withdraw their remaining coins and stop playing on CSGOEmpire.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
