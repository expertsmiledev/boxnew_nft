">CSGOEmpire is one of the oldest CSGO gambling sites, established in early 2016. Since then, with over 2 billion dollars wagered, CSGOEmpire has become by far the most popular CSGO gambling website.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">As you may know, CSGO gambling doesn't have a good reputation. For the most part, CSGO gambling sites have been non-regulated, non-transparent, in many cases illegal, and worst out of all -- fraudulent. Our mission is to fix that. CSGOEmpire is widely known for its stance on fairness and transparency. We are one of the first licensed and regulated skin gambling websites, and we do our best to make the system as fair and as transparent as possible.<span class="block pb-lg"></span></p><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="whos-behind" style="

">Step 2</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Hi, I'm known as Monarch.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">In 2015, I started building CSGOEmpire from my bedroom - It all started with a small 11,000€ loan, my business partner, and a couple of freelancers.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Since then, we've grown massively, and we now employ some of the most brilliant minds in the gambling industry. We're a group of passionate gamers, gamblers, professional poker players, (e)sports bettors, and the list goes on. However, we prefer to keep our team as small and as tight as possible, and we pay them better salaries than most of the top technology companies in the world.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Our company, Moonrail Limited, is located in Curaçao. However, our team is entirely remote. Our team consists of people from over ten different countries worldwide, the majority being from Europe.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">I'm personally known for my work as an advocate for fair and transparent gambling, as I'm often heavily criticizing the shadier operators in this scene.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="is-it-legal" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">Step 3</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Yes - CSGOEmpire is fully licensed and regulated. You can find our license information by clicking the license badge in the footer.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="country-block" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">Step 4</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Due to the laws and regulations, we've restricted access from some countries. For example, online gambling is not permitted in the USA, which is why we don't allow traffic from USA IP addresses.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="withdrawal-limits" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">Step 5</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">With skins - There are none.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">With Bitcoin and Ethereum, we require you to verify your identity if you want to withdraw more than 2000 coins total. After verifying your identity, you will be able to withdraw unlimited amounts.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Whether you are playing with pennies or gambling with millions, it's a huge priority for us to offer you a smooth and consistent experience when withdrawing. At CSGOEmpire, you should not face any unexpected surprises.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">At most times, we have more than $50 million worth of Bitcoin in our cold storage. However, the balance in our hot wallets rarely exceeds more than $3 million. If you are looking to withdraw amounts bigger than that, you may need to wait a couple of days for us to re-fill our wallets.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="betting-limits" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">What are the betting limits?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">On roulette, the maximum bet amount is 100,000 coins. However, we can easily increase this upon request.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">In match betting, the limits vary from player to player. In order to stop us from bleeding money to some professional bettors, we need to set strict betting limits on their accounts.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="underaged" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">What about underaged gambling?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Like any regulated casino, we don't allow minors to gamble. We do KYC (Know-Your-Customer) checks, which means that the players have to confirm their identity, location, and age.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="how-kyc-works" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">How do the KYC checks work?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When you first sign up on CSGOEmpire, we ask you to write your personal information.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Then, as required by the laws, rules, and moral standards, there are scenarios where we request players to prove their personal information. Below are some example scenarios where we perform a KYC check:</p><p class="size-large"></p><ul><li style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When you deposit substantial amounts of money</li><li style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When you attempt to withdraw over 2000 coins (cumulative) worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum</li><li style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">For example, in cases of suspicious behavior, if there is a suspicion of the player being underaged.</li></ul><p></p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">When a player is required to complete a KYC check, their option to deposit, withdraw, or gamble their coins, will be blocked. The KYC is completed by submitting one document with proof of identity and one with proof of address.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">If the player refuses or fails to complete the check, they will remain blocked from depositing and gambling -- Essentially, they must withdraw their remaining coins and stop playing on CSGOEmpire.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="kyc-safety" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">Is it safe to give you my identity documents?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">KYC checks are done with the help of <a href="https://shuftipro.com/" target="_blank">Shuftipro</a>. The documents are stored on Shuftipro's servers and in our own backups (required by legal purposes), and most of them are analyzed automatically with AI. If the AI cannot read your documents clearly, then one of our employees will manually check the documents.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">We understand that this kind of data is sensitive, and that's why we treat it with care and respect. We do our best to keep the data secure, and we aim to delete it as soon as possible. We collect this data only to confirm that you are eligible to gamble -- We will never sell your data.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="valve-gambling" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
"> Isn't gambling against the rules of Valve?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Technically, yes. However, this is not a law -- It's just a rule of Valve.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">In 2016, a couple of fraudulent operators caused some trouble for Valve. Followed by this, Valve was pressured to publish a statement where they wrote that using CSGO skins for commercial use would be prohibited.</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">From a player's point of view, this should not be a problem at all. Gambling with CSGO skins does not break any laws, and Valve has never banned any Steam users for gambling. Even though Valve has been trade-banning gambling site bots, the gamblers have remained untouched.</p></div><div class="tab-body"><h2 id="empire-bot-bans" style="
    color: #d7d7d7;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
">Do CSGOEmpire's Steam bots get banned?</h2><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">In the past, CSGOEmpire's deposit and withdrawal system used to rely on Steam bots until we came up with a brilliant innovation back in 2018; We created the "P2P" system, which stands for "peer-to-peer" or "player-to-player".</p><p class="size-large" style="
    color: #c9c9c9;
">Thanks to the P2P system, CSGOEmpire can now operate without using Steam bots.</p></div><div class="blackboard blackboard-other"><div class="blackboard-content flex"><div class="blackboard-body"><h3 style="
